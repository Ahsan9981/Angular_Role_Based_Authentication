6.  Short Import syntax as a productivity hack.
7.  Module Based routing and feature module. [Version 1].
8.  Data Resolvers Demo. [Version 2].
9.  Lazy Loading of feature modules and routing. [Version 3].
10. Angular authentication guard implementation & application.
11. Error Handling in Angular.
